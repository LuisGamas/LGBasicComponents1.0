This library contains components that can be added to the Netbeans palette, the .jar file contains everything you need. Initial version 1.0. There may be some small bugs but as time goes by I will try to improve them.  THESE COMPONENTS ARE COMPLETELY FREE FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS THEM, SELLING THEM IS FORBIDDEN.
